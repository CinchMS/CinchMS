CinchMS
======
**Simple CMS engine built for developer end-users**, easy to integrate with an existing site built on html-css-js

Project idea
-----
I have been looking for a CMS _(content manage system)_ that simplified the management process, 
but I havenâ€™t found anything similar... That is why **I decided to create my own CMS _built for 
developer end-users_**, giving them a real free hand over a simple and clean system without useless functions.
